Actors, on strike since July 14, are likewise seeking better compensation from streaming. But they are also demanding [safeguards against AI](https://apnews.com/article/hollywood-ai-strike-wga-artificial-intelligence-39ab72582c3a15f77510c9c30a45ffc8), which can potentially use a starâ€™s likeness without his or her permission or replace background actors entirely.
- Might teachers face similar existential [concerns](https://github.com/abikesa/language/blob/main/README.md)?
- Isn't all this acknowledgment of the power of AI?
- What exactly are the ethics of copyright and patents?
- Didn't pharmaceutics make exemptions of HIV/AIDS drugs?
- Exemptions for low income countries leading to PEPFAR?

Can't we use this narrative for AI and education in low income countries:
- Clearly ChatGPT is powerful enough to make professional afraid of competition
- But if we suppose the ethics of copyright to the data on which ChatGPT are addressed:
- Then can't we by analogy go ahead with a PEPFAR equivalent for education:
- Making ChatGPT and other AI supported application accesible?
- Especially in settings beset by a student: teacher ratio > XX?

Which brings us to the main issue:
- Truth?
- Knowledge?
- Ethics?
- What is the purpose of education?
- For settings with high student: teacher ratio AI serves an `empowering`, ethical end

1. Truth/Voir/Whineth, $\Large \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\partial y$
   - Everything that is seen, smelt, heard, tasted, felt; verb: to see
   - But within a hierarchical system these inputs are [selectively biased](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/us/harvard-students-israel-hamas-doxxing.html)
   - Time span, distribution of characteristics, estimates of incidents, measurement, censorship
     
2. Knowledge/Savoir/Tameth, $\Large \int_{j}^{k} \partial y \partial x$
   - Underlying hypothesis that truth is some constant; verb: to be
   - Alternative is that you never step in the same river twice
   - But really its the rates of change, $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$
3. [Ethics](https://www.iesalc.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ChatGPT-and-Artificial-Intelligence-in-higher-education-Quick-Start-guide_EN_FINAL.pdf)/Pouvoir/Hideth, $\Large \int_{Evil}^{Good} \partial x$
